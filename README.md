TODO: Get this to a point where people can at least use it somewhat. 

Lets try to get hitomi and me to play in the same chat. 

Get sessions working.
    reproduce the session error tmr and post on stack overflow. 
    Click a button and new window new session 
        - use the concept of a room

    /session/:id

Have a nice css layout.

Get two-way playing on the same keyboard working.
    If two people press 'play' it should just work .
    
Handle multiple initialization attempts. 
Show error if no keyboard connect and try to play.

Batch notes played, like chords, so that many pitches can be grouped into one packet, but only 
on playing down. 
Really pin down the sound, and do a good job with it (remove the cycles)
