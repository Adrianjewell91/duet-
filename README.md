TODO: Lets try to get hitomi and me to play in the same chat. 

Test two way playing, hopefully with Hitomi or Matt Slaughter.

Get sessions working.
    Start a session
    Join a current session:

    /session/:id

Have a nicer css layout. - add a nice picture and a background video later. 

Figure out how to write a calibration function for multiple instruments;
Do something like:
    Calibrate your instrument:
        Play one note 
            Capture the events

Handle multiple initialization attempts. 

Add some calibration for new midi instruments.

Batch notes played, like chords, so that many pitches can be grouped into one packet, but only 
on playing down. 
Really pin down the sound, and do a good job with it (remove the cycles)
    - Overtones series 
    - Different pitches have different filters.
    - Add pedal somehow. 
    _ set sustain time to be a function of pitch.
