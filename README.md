Get sessions working.
    reproduce the session error tmr and post on stack overflow. 
    Click a button and new window new session 
        - use the concept of a room

    /session/:id

Have a nice css layout. - add a nice picture and a background video later. 

Send binary data instead of a serialized json object (faster?)
Handle multiple initialization attempts. 

Add some calibration for new midi instruments.

Batch notes played, like chords, so that many pitches can be grouped into one packet, but only 
on playing down. 
Really pin down the sound, and do a good job with it (remove the cycles)
